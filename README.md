# Project name: Online zoo

_**Online zoo** is basically a website created to simulate a visit to a zoo, and the visitors to this site can view exhibits about animals and their habitats. Many Zoos as well as schools have developed virtual zoos. For example, a virtual zoo will have articles, vieos and photos as exhibits instead of actual animals._
